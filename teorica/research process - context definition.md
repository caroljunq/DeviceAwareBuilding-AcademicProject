Abstract

>The paper concerns the construction of applications for active spaces that
support mobile users in an unobtrusive ubiquitous computing environment that
couples models and virtual representations to the physical world. Traditional
applications are often statically bound to resources, context insensitive,
directed toward sequential computation, and do not support the activities of a
mobile user. We propose a model for mobile applications that support mobile
users, devices, and services in which the interactive nature of information and
physical space is represented. We build on existing technology, extending the
notion of the Model-View-Controller pattern to accommodate the requirements of
ubiquitous computing.

A User-Centric, Resource-Aware, Context-Sensitive, Multi-Device Application
Framework for Ubiquitous Computing Environments

Manuel Roman and Roy H. Campbell

Abstract

> Ubiquitous computing challenges the conventional notion of a user logged into
a personal computing device, whether it is a desktop, a laptop, or a digital
assistant. When the physical environment of a user contains hundreds of
networked computer devices each of which may be used to support one or more user
applications, the notion of personal computing becomes inadequate. Further, when
a group of users share such a physical environment, new forms of sharing,
cooperation and collaboration are possible and mobile users may constantly
change the computers with which they interact. We present in this paper an
application framework that provides mechanisms to construct, run or adapt
existing applications to ubiquitous computing environments. The framework binds
applications to users, uses multiple devices simultaneously, and exploits
resource management within the users' environment that reacts to context and
mobility. Our research contributes to application mobility, partitioning and
adaptation within device rich environments, and uses context-awareness to focus
the resources of ubiquitous computing environments on the needs of users.

My highlights:

Has a definition of context

> Context is any information that can be used to characterize the
situation of an entity. An entity is a person, place, or object that is
considered relevant to the interaction between a user and an application,
including the user and applications themselves.

Has a Definition of Context-Aware

> A system is context-aware if it uses context to provide relevant information
and/or services to the user, where relevancy depends on
the user’s task.

SUMMARY
> Traditional interactive applications are limited to using only the input that users explicitly provide. As users
move away from traditional desktop computing environments and move towards mobile and ubiquitous
computing environments, there is a greater need for applications to leverage from implicit information, or
context.These types of environments are rich in context, with users and devices moving around and
computational services becoming available or disappearing over time. This information is usually not
available to applications but can be useful in adapting the way in which it performs its services and in
changing the available services. Applications that use context are known as context-aware applications.
> This research in context-aware computing has focused on the development of a software architecture to
support the building of context-aware applications. While developers have been able to build context-aware
applications, they have been limited to using a small variety of sensors that provide only simple context
such as identity and location. This dissertation presents a set of requirements and component abstractions
for a conceptual supporting framework. The framework along with an identified design process makes it
easier to acquire and deliver context to applications, and in turn, build more complex context-aware
applications.
> In addition, an implementation of the framework called the Context Toolkit is discussed, along with a
number of context-aware applications that have been built with it. The applications illustrate how the
toolkit is used in practice and allows an exploration of the design space of context-aware computing. This
dissertation also shows how the Context Toolkit has been used as a research testbed, supporting the
investigation of difficult problems in context-aware computing such as the building of high-level
programming abstractions, dealing with ambiguous or inaccurate context data and controlling access to
personal context.

Abstract
> This paper describes software that examines and reacts to an individual’s changing context. Such software
can promote and mediate people’s interactions with devices, computers, and other people, and it can help
navigate unfamiliar places. We believe that a limited amount of information covering a person’s proximate
environment is most important for this form of computing since the interesting part of the world around
us is what we can see, hear, and touch. In this paper we define context-aware computing, and describe
four categories of context-aware applications: proximate selection, automatic contextual reconfiguration,
contextual information and commands, and context-triggered actions. Instances of these application types
have been prototyped on the PARCTAB, a wireless, palm-sized computer.
