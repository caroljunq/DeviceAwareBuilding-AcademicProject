abstract = {In this paper we address the problem of distance measurement in indoor IEEE 802.11 WLANs. The received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and the Signal Propagation Time (SPT) have been widely used for distance estimation in indoor WLAN deployments. However, neither approach by itself is accurate. Moreover, there is no mean by which WLAN nodes know whether the estimated distance is accurate or not. In this work we propose a multi-measurement approach. Specifically, we combine an RSSI and a propagation time-based schemes and utilize both results for mutual cross-validation to improve the estimation accuracy and reduce the number of false decisions based on errored estimations. The performance of our combined mechanism has been evaluated through real experiments.},

abstract = {This paper presents the experimental evaluation of a Bluetooth-based positioning system. The method has been implemented in a Bluetooth-capable handheld device. Empirical tests of the developed considered positioning system have been realized in different indoor scenarios. The range estimation of the positioning system is based on an approximation of the between relation the RSSI (Radio Signal Strength Indicator) and the associated distance between sender and receiver. The actual location estimation is carried out by using the triangulation method. The implementation of the positioning system in a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) has been realized by using the Software "Microsoft eMbedded Visual C++ Version 3.0‚Äù.},
