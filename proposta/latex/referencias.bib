Consider writing, perhaps the first information technology: The ability to capture a symbolic representation of spoken language for long-term storage freed information from the limits of individual memory. Today this technology is ubiquitous in industrialized countries. Not only do books, magazines and newspapers convey written information, but so do street signs, billboards, shop signs and even graffiti. Candy wrappers are covered in writing. The constant background presence of these products of "literacy technology" does not require active attention, but the information to be conveyed is ready for use at a glance. It is difficult to imagine modern life otherwise. Silicon-based information technology, in contrast, is far from having become part of the environment. More than 50 million personal computers have been sold, and nonetheless the computer remains largely in a world of its own. It is approachable only through complex jargon that has nothing to do with the tasks for which which people actually use computers. The state of the art is perhaps analogous to the period when scribes had to know as much about making ink or baking clay as they did about writing.},

	abstract = {Currently in development, numerous geolocation technologies can pinpoint a person's or object's position on the Earth. Knowledge of the spatial distribution of wireless callers will facilitate the planning, design, and operation of next generation broadband wireless networks. Mobile users will gain the ability to get local traffic information and detailed directions to gas stations, restaurants, hotels, and other services. Police and rescue teams will be able to quickly and precisely locate people who are lost or injured but cannot give their precise location. Companies will use geolocation based applications to track personnel, vehicles, and other assets. The driving force behind the development of this technology is a US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) mandate stating that by 1 October 2001 all wireless carriers must provide the geolocation of an emergency 911 caller to the appropriate public safety answering point. Location technologies requiring new modified, or upgraded mobile stations must determine the caller's longitude and latitude within 50 meters for 67 percent of emergency calls, and within 150 meters for 95 percent of the calls. Otherwise, they must do so within 100 meters and 300 meters, respectively, for the same percentage of calls. Currently deployed wireless technology can locate 911 calls within an area no smaller than 10 to 15 square kilometers. It is argued that assisted-GPS technology offers superior accuracy, availability, and coverage at a reasonable cost},

	    Context-aware computing is a mobile computing paradigm in which
	    applications can discover and take advantage of contextual information
	    (such as user location, time of day, nearby people and devices, and
	    user activity). Since it was proposed about a decade ago, many
	    researchers have studied this topic and built several context-aware
	    applications to demonstrate the usefulness of this new
	    technology. Context-aware applications (or the system infrastructure
	    to support them), however, have never been widely available to
	    everyday users. In this survey of research on context-aware systems
	    and applications, we looked in depth at the types of context used and
	    models of context information, at systems that support collecting and
	    disseminating context, and at applications that adapt to the changing
	    context. Through this survey, it is clear that context-aware research
	    is an old but rich area for research. The difficulties and possible
	    solutions we outline serve as guidance for researchers hoping to make
	    context-aware computing a reality.

Identification and tracking technologies, wired and wireless sensor and actuator networks, enhanced communication protocols (shared with the Next Generation Internet), and distributed intelligence for smart objects are just the most relevant. As one can easily imagine, any serious contribution to the advance of the Internet of Things must necessarily be the result of synergetic activities conducted in different fields of knowledge, such as telecommunications, informatics, electronics and social science. In such a complex scenario, this survey is directed to those who want to approach this complex discipline and contribute to its development. Different visions of this Internet of Things paradigm are reported and enabling technologies reviewed. What emerges is that still major issues shall be faced by the research community. The most relevant among them are addressed in details. "
