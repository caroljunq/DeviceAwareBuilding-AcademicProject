abstract = {The world of home automation is an exciting field that has exploded with new technologies and today is known as an area where “The internet of things” (IoT) vision becomes reality. The primary advantages that stem from this concept include how each device forms a small part of the Internet, by which the advanced system is able to interact and communicate, maximizes safety, security, comfort, convenience and energy-savings. This paper proposes an implementation of Sensor Web node as a part of IoT using a Raspberry Pi – inexpensive, fully customizable and programmable small computer with support for a large number of peripherals and network communication. Using this technology, in an example of monitoring and determining the confidence of fire in building, a full system, based on Sensor Web elements, is created and developed starting from a scratch. The given example confirms the advantage of Raspberry Pi – flexibility and extensive possibility of its usage.},

abstract = {In a ubiquitous computing environment, location awareness is a basic necessity. There are various research projects, which discuss the problem of indoor location sensing. We have recognized acceptability, low power consumption, and cost as the key design factors for developing widely deployable location sensing systems. As a good candidate technology that could satisfy these needs, we proposed a location sensing system based on the widely available Bluetooth medium. Location evaluation is preformed by sensing Bluetooth signal strength with a reference model based approach. We discuss problems which arise when the Bluetooth RSSI (received signal strength indicator) is used as a signal strength indicator, and propose a novel access point that supports variable attenuators to overcome these problems. This access point allows the reading of a wider range of signal strengths using RSSI. We show that our approach to location sensing has reduced the error rate about threefold compared to systems which do not use variable attenuator supported access points.},

@article{Dey1999,
abstract = {In biology teaching, ecological subjects play an important role in dealing with nature in a responsible way. Empirical research has shown that, even after school instruction, students do not understand essential ecological concepts. The main reason is that preconceptions which influence learning are not taken into account in the construction of curricula. We combine findings from two independently-designed studies which have their main objectives in common. In both studies the focus is on students' conceptions of ecological terms and phenomena-ecosystem, and balance-and-change in nature. The studies were conducted within the framework of Educational Reconstruction, where three components of research are linked together: 'scientific clarification', 'comprehension of students' perspectives' and 'construction of instruction'. In order to capture the structure and quality of students' conceptions, qualitative methods were used. The results of both studies indicate that students tend to refer to more or less constant properties, in particular those which are visible in the everyday world. Processes are rarely their concern. Therefore the scientific conceptions of ecosystem, imbalance and the dynamics of biodiversity would be difficult for them to understand. For a better understanding, the dimensions of both space and time should be included in curricular design.},

Empirical tests of the developed considered positioning system have been realized in different indoor scenarios. The range estimation of the positioning system is based on an approximation of the between relation the RSSI (Radio Signal Strength Indicator) and the associated distance between sender and receiver. The actual location estimation is carried out by using the triangulation method. The implementation of the positioning system in a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) has been realized by using the Software "Microsoft eMbedded Visual C++ Version 3.0”.},

abstract = {We provide an elaborate discussion on Bluetooth signal parameters with respect to localization, whereby we collectively designate all types of Bluetooth specification parameters that are related to signal strength - such as RSSI, Link Quality, Received and Transmit Power Level - as Bluetooth signal, parameters. According to our analysis and experimental results, "RSSI" and "Transmit Power Level" turn out to be poor candidates for localization, while "Link Quality" has its limitations. On the other hand, "Received Power Level" correlates nicely with distance, which makes it the most desirable Bluetooth signal parameter to be used in location systems. We contend that it is vital to choose the appropriate signal parameter in Bluetooth location systems, and we expect our work to provide useful pointers in any future design of such systems. Existing systems can also benefit by adopting the appropriate Bluetooth signal parameter in their systems, and thereby, improve their location accuracy.},

@article{Dey2000,
abstract = {Traditional interactive applications are limited to using only the input that users explicitly provide. As users move away from traditional desktop computing environments and move towards mobile and ubiquitous computing environments, there is a greater need for applications to leverage from implicit information, or context. These types of environments are rich in context, with users and devices moving around and computational services becoming available or disappearing over time. This information is usually not available to applications but can be useful in adapting the way in which it performs its services and in changing the available services. Applications that use context are known as context-aware applications. This research in context-aware computing has focused on the development of a software architecture to support the building of context-aware applications. While developers have been able to build context-aware applications, they have been limited to using a small variety of sensors that provide only simple context such as identity and location. This dissertation presents a set of requirements and component abstractions for a conceptual supporting framework. The framework along with an identified design process makes it easier to acquire and deliver context to applications, and in turn, build more complex context-aware applications. In addition, an implementation of the framework called the Context Toolkit is discussed, along with a number of context-aware applications that have been built with it. The applications illustrate how the toolkit is used in practice and allows an exploration of the design space of context-aware computing. This dissertation also shows how the Context Toolkit has been used as a research testbed, supporting the investigation of difficult problems in context-aware computing such as the building of high-level programming abstractions, dealing with ambiguous or inaccurate context data and controlling access to personal context.},

The received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and the Signal Propagation Time (SPT) have been widely used for distance estimation in indoor WLAN deployments. However, neither approach by itself is accurate. Moreover, there is no mean by which WLAN nodes know whether the estimated distance is accurate or not. In this work we propose a multi-measurement approach. Specifically, we combine an RSSI and a propagation time-based schemes and utilize both results for mutual cross-validation to improve the estimation accuracy and reduce the number of false decisions based on errored estimations. The performance of our combined mechanism has been evaluated through real experiments.},

Consider writing, perhaps the first information technology: The ability to capture a symbolic representation of spoken language for long-term storage freed information from the limits of individual memory. Today this technology is ubiquitous in industrialized countries. Not only do books, magazines and newspapers convey written information, but so do street signs, billboards, shop signs and even graffiti. Candy wrappers are covered in writing. The constant background presence of these products of "literacy technology" does not require active attention, but the information to be conveyed is ready for use at a glance. It is difficult to imagine modern life otherwise. Silicon-based information technology, in contrast, is far from having become part of the environment. More than 50 million personal computers have been sold, and nonetheless the computer remains largely in a world of its own. It is approachable only through complex jargon that has nothing to do with the tasks for which which people actually use computers. The state of the art is perhaps analogous to the period when scribes had to know as much about making ink or baking clay as they did about writing.},
