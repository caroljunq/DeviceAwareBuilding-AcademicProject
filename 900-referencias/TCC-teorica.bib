abstract = {In a ubiquitous computing environment, location awareness is a basic necessity. There are various research projects, which discuss the problem of indoor location sensing. We have recognized acceptability, low power consumption, and cost as the key design factors for developing widely deployable location sensing systems. As a good candidate technology that could satisfy these needs, we proposed a location sensing system based on the widely available Bluetooth medium. Location evaluation is preformed by sensing Bluetooth signal strength with a reference model based approach. We discuss problems which arise when the Bluetooth RSSI (received signal strength indicator) is used as a signal strength indicator, and propose a novel access point that supports variable attenuators to overcome these problems. This access point allows the reading of a wider range of signal strengths using RSSI. We show that our approach to location sensing has reduced the error rate about threefold compared to systems which do not use variable attenuator supported access points.},

@article{Dey1999,
abstract = {In biology teaching, ecological subjects play an important role in dealing with nature in a responsible way. Empirical research has shown that, even after school instruction, students do not understand essential ecological concepts. The main reason is that preconceptions which influence learning are not taken into account in the construction of curricula. We combine findings from two independently-designed studies which have their main objectives in common. In both studies the focus is on students' conceptions of ecological terms and phenomena-ecosystem, and balance-and-change in nature. The studies were conducted within the framework of Educational Reconstruction, where three components of research are linked together: 'scientific clarification', 'comprehension of students' perspectives' and 'construction of instruction'. In order to capture the structure and quality of students' conceptions, qualitative methods were used. The results of both studies indicate that students tend to refer to more or less constant properties, in particular those which are visible in the everyday world. Processes are rarely their concern. Therefore the scientific conceptions of ecosystem, imbalance and the dynamics of biodiversity would be difficult for them to understand. For a better understanding, the dimensions of both space and time should be included in curricular design.},

Bluetooth is oriented to connecting close devices, serving as a substitute for cables, while Wi-Fi is oriented toward computer-to-computer connections, as an extension of or substitution for cabled LANs. In this article we offer an overview of these popular wireless communication standards, comparing their main features and behaviors in terms of various metrics, including capacity, network topology, security, quality of service support, and power consumption.},

abstract = {The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it. Consider writing, perhaps the first information technology: The ability to capture a symbolic representation of spoken language for long-term storage freed information from the limits of individual memory. Today this technology is ubiquitous in industrialized countries. Not only do books, magazines and newspapers convey written information, but so do street signs, billboards, shop signs and even graffiti. Candy wrappers are covered in writing. The constant background presence of these products of "literacy technology" does not require active attention, but the information to be conveyed is ready for use at a glance. It is difficult to imagine modern life otherwise. Silicon-based information technology, in contrast, is far from having become part of the environment. More than 50 million personal computers have been sold, and nonetheless the computer remains largely in a world of its own. It is approachable only through complex jargon that has nothing to do with the tasks for which which people actually use computers. The state of the art is perhaps analogous to the period when scribes had to know as much about making ink or baking clay as they did about writing.},

abstract = {‚Äì We present Chronos, a system that enables a single WiFi access point to localize clients to within tens of centimeters. Such a system can bring indoor position-ing to homes and small businesses which typically have a single access point. The key enabler underlying Chronos is a novel algo-rithm that can compute sub-nanosecond time-of-flight us-ing commodity WiFi cards. By multiplying the time-of-flight with the speed of light, a MIMO access point com-putes the distance between each of its antennas and the client, hence localizing it. Our implementation on com-modity WiFi cards demonstrates that Chronos's accu-racy is comparable to state-of-the-art localization systems, which use four or five access points.},
