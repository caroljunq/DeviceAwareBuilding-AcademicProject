abstract = {Currently in development, numerous geolocation technologies can pinpoint a person's or object's position on the Earth. Knowledge of the spatial distribution of wireless callers will facilitate the planning, design, and operation of next generation broadband wireless networks. Mobile users will gain the ability to get local traffic information and detailed directions to gas stations, restaurants, hotels, and other services. Police and rescue teams will be able to quickly and precisely locate people who are lost or injured but cannot give their precise location. Companies will use geolocation based applications to track personnel, vehicles, and other assets. The driving force behind the development of this technology is a US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) mandate stating that by 1 October 2001 all wireless carriers must provide the geolocation of an emergency 911 caller to the appropriate public safety answering point. Location technologies requiring new modified, or upgraded mobile stations must determine the caller's longitude and latitude within 50 meters for 67 percent of emergency calls, and within 150 meters for 95 percent of the calls. Otherwise, they must do so within 100 meters and 300 meters, respectively, for the same percentage of calls. Currently deployed wireless technology can locate 911 calls within an area no smaller than 10 to 15 square kilometers. It is argued that assisted-GPS technology offers superior accuracy, availability, and coverage at a reasonable cost},

Context-aware computing is a mobile computing paradigm in which
applications can discover and take advantage of contextual information
(such as user location, time of day, nearby people and devices, and
user activity). Since it was proposed about a decade ago, many
researchers have studied this topic and built several context-aware
applications to demonstrate the usefulness of this new
technology. Context-aware applications (or the system infrastructure
to support them), however, have never been widely available to
everyday users. In this survey of research on context-aware systems
and applications, we looked in depth at the types of context used and
models of context information, at systems that support collecting and
disseminating context, and at applications that adapt to the changing
context. Through this survey, it is clear that context-aware research
is an old but rich area for research. The difficulties and possible
