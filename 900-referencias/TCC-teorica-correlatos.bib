abstract = {â€“ We present Chronos, a system that enables a single WiFi access point to localize clients to within tens of centimeters. Such a system can bring indoor position-ing to homes and small businesses which typically have a single access point. The key enabler underlying Chronos is a novel algo-rithm that can compute sub-nanosecond time-of-flight us-ing commodity WiFi cards. By multiplying the time-of-flight with the speed of light, a MIMO access point com-putes the distance between each of its antennas and the client, hence localizing it. Our implementation on com-modity WiFi cards demonstrates that Chronos's accu-racy is comparable to state-of-the-art localization systems, which use four or five access points.},
