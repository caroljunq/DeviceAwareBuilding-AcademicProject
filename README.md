# DeviceAwareBuilding-AcademicProject

Documentation and papers of **Luís Puhl's Bachelor Thesis** - A internet
connected sensor network intended to locate contextually connected devices (aka
IoT and mobile) inside a building thus making it and its managers (and anyone or
anything allowed) aware of the devices location.

## Enviroment

 - Windows 10
 - Git
 - TeX Live for windows
 - Texstudio
 - Atom (with the following packages)
	- latex
	- language-latex
	- pdf-view (PDF.js)

# TODO

## Structural
- [ ] Add *"DeviceAwareBuilding"* sufix to publication files (\*.pdf);

## Theoretical Validity
- [ ] Image map and Logical Map definition;
	- [ ] URI pattern for the logical map;
	- [ ] URI pattern for the logical map;
	- [ ] Example of reuse (Marcelo's case);
- [ ] Extend Semantic Web use across the work;
- [ ] Expand the definition of `Device Context in a building`;

# Project Phases (fases do projeto)

## Proposal (proposta)

The objective of this phase was a formal and science funded document describing
the focus problem and the proposed solution for it.

The result documents and presentation of this phase can be found in the following versions:

## Theoretical Validity (fundamentação teórica)

At this point with a solid proposal we build a set of theoretical assumptions
surrounding every fundamental stone to the main idea. This process consists in
the idea itself been is broken in aspects, this aspects will be exposed and
discussed individually so the greater idea can be validated.
